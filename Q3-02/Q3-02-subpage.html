    <h1>This is another page in the Q3-02 website</h1>
    <a href="Q3-02.html">Home</a>
    <p>Now, if you click the link above this paragraph, it will take you back to the Q3-02 home page.</p>
    <a href="Q3-02-subpage.html">Subpage</a>
    <p>If you click the link above this paragraph, it will take you to this page. Links work to take you to other pages as well as places within the page you're already looking at.</p>
    <p>Links that take you to other places on a website or on the Web are called hyperlinks and are represented with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> element tags when you're writing or reading HTML. HTML stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language</i>. We call HTML <i>markup</i> instead of <i>code</i> because it's simply text with extra tags to help your browser make it look the way the author intended. For example, to make your browser italicize the words <i>markup</i> and <i>code</i> I wrapped them in tags. So here is what the previous sentence looks like in HTML: <code><pre>For example, to make your browser italicize the words &lt;i&gt;markup&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;code&lt;/i&gt; I wrapped them in tags.</pre></code></p>
    <p>So HTML markup takes text and adds <i>tags</i> to structure and organize the text into <i>elements</i>. This paragraph is a <code>paragraph</code> element and we tell the browser this by surrounding it with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags. An <i>opening tag</i> is composed of an opening angle bracket, the name of the element, and a closing angle bracket. A <i>closing tag</i> is composed of an opening angle bracket, a forward slash, the name of the element, and a closing angle bracket. Only a few elements have only a single tag, and those end with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started">You can read more about the basic concepts of HTML here if you finish early.</a></p>
    <p>The background of this page is <code>lightseagreen</code>, and I made it this way using a CSS file. CSS stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheet.</i></p> HTML gives your page structure, while CSS gives it style. CSS rules contain a selector and at least one property and value. The selector will match a tag, class, or ID from your HTML markup. My CSS for this page contains one rule with one selector, two properties, and two values:
    <code><pre>body {
    background-color: lightseagreen;
    font-family: serif;
}</pre></code>
    The selector is <code>body</code>, the properties are <code>background-color</code> and <code>font-family</code>, and the values are <code>lightseagreen</code> and <code>serif</code>. That means the rule will apply to the entire visible page (the body), making the background light sea green with a serif font. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works">You can read more about the basic concepts of CSS here if you finish early.</a></p>
    <p>At this point you should take the <a href="">review quiz</a>. If you finish early, go back and work on making up your Q2 projects if you did not pass, or work on Typing.com if you have passed your Q2 projects.</p>
